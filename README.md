# Airbnb Clone Project Overview
This project is a full-stack Airbnb clone application that replicates core features of the Airbnb platform, allowing users to browse, book, and host short-term rentals. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building real-world web applications using modern technologies, and to demonstrate proficiency in both frontend and backend development.

## Project Goals
- Build a responsive, interactive web application using a modern tech stack.
- Implement key functionalities such as user authentication, property listings, and bookings.
- Practice integration of third-party services (e.g. cloud storage, payment APIs).
- Gain experience with full-stack architecture and deployment.


## Features Implemented
- 🔐 User authentication (register, login, logout)
- 🏠 Browse and search listings
- 📆 Book properties with date selection
- 💬 Add reviews for listings
- 🧑‍💼 Host dashboard to manage listings
- 📸 Image upload for properties
- 📱 Fully responsive design


## Team Roles
**Backend Developer:** Engineers the product logic and algorithms that connects the systems together. Controls the server-side logic and maintains API's that connects to components of the application.

**Frontend Developer:** Engineers the interface the user interacts with. Ensures that the designs from the UI/UX team is implemented in code.

**Database Administrator:** Manages the database to ensure data integrity ,performance and security.Ensures that database queries are optimized.

**Business Analyst:** This individual performs the tasks of understanding customer business process and translates their needs into requirements, they analyze customer feedback in order to align customer's vision with development.

**Product Owners:** He/She enusres customer satisfaction in terms of making the customer product a success. They plan the product backlog to ensure that the vision of the customer is met.It is not however technical unlike the BA.

**Project Manager:** Ensures the timely delivery of product and make sure that expenditure is within budget. Plans activities, distributes roles and updates status of the team in relation to meeting timelines.

**UI/UX Designer:** Prepares a design that best suites the product vision and user journeys to explain interactivity between the user and the screen. Focuses on enhancing experience over time.

**Software Architects:** Designs the structure of overall system architecture. Puts in place what tools will be needed to build a product solution and sets up code quality standards and reviews.

**Quality Assurance Engineers:** Ensures that application matches requirements and sees the functional and non-functional defects. Evaluates what the application should do and how the application should do it, to fufil this, QA tests are cnducted.

**Test Automation Engineers:** Fufils the tasks of writing and maintainig a series of repetitive tasks through building a tests scripts that can carry out these tasks in without human involvment.

**DevOps Engineers:** Facilates cooperation between the developement and automation teams and builds continous integration and continous delivery pipelines to ensure faster devlivery of software. Manages infrastructure and monitors logging and cloud services.

## Technology Stack
#### Frontend:
**React.js:** It is an open source Javascript library used to build responsive user interfaces on UI components.

**Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap):** A utility first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custome interfacesdirectly within HTML.

**React Router:** Used to handle client-side routing navigation in react application.

**Axios / Fetch API:** Used to make HTTP requests to backend services from the frontend.

**Docker:** A containerization tool that packages the ap and its dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

**Kubernetes:** An orchestration tool used to automate deployment, sclaing and management of containerized applications.

**GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD tool that automates testing, building and deployment of code from GitHub.

**Amazon Web Services:** A cloud platform used to deploy services 

### Testing:
**Jest:** A testing framework for javascript, commonly used to test frontend and backend logic.

**Cypress:** An end to end testing tool that tests how users interact with the application.

**Postman:** An API testing tool that allows developers anf QA to tests HTTP requests and backend API

**Selenium:** A browser automation tool for testing web applications across different browsers

### Monitoring:
**Prometheus:** A monitoring system that collects and stores metrics from applications and infrastructure.

**Grafana:** A visaulisation tool used to display monitoring data from prometheus or sources in real time dashbaords.
